# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This repository contains a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for checking the strength of a password. The strength is determined based on a set of rules, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The application offers real-time feedback on the password's strength and suggests improvements to meet security standards.

Additionally, the repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that explains the code components and logic behind the password strength assessment and the GUI design.

## Features

- **Password Strength Assessment**: The application evaluates passwords based on length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides instant feedback on how to improve the password, ensuring that users can create stronger passwords.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to enter passwords and get results easily.
- **Feedback for Improvements**: If the password is weak, the application suggests ways to strengthen it.
- **Check Another Password**: After each check, users can reset the form to check another password.
- **Code Explanation**: The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that explains the code and logic behind the program for educational purposes.
